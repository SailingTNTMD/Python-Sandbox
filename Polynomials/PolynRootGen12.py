Name: PolynRootGen9
Date: 20180903
Author: Lio Hong
Purpose: Produce a polynomial from user-inputted roots
Took a break to better understand itertools lib.
Subtasks:
X Process the coefficients and constants from the roots into lists
Generate coef for each n^x term for x in range(i)
      Sort coefs by value of x
      Generate combinations based on number of terms from COEF (and thus from CONST)
      X Select exclusive entries from COEF and CONST lists using itertools.compress()
      Sum sub-coefs together for n^x term
Return final expression in linear form
'' in table form

'''
Trying to produce a loop that runs through all a-values for a term
then moves on to the next term and runs through all a-values again
So gen all the possible combinations first.
(Not gen directly, but have the POTENTIAL to gen them)
Then remove the overlapping ones.
