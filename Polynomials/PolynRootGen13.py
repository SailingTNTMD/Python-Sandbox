Name: PolynRootGen13
Date: 20180905
Author: Lio Hong
Purpose: Produce a polynomial from user-inputted roots
Took a break to better understand itertools lib.
Subtasks:
X Process the coefficients and constants from the roots into lists
Generate coef for each n^x term for x in range(i)
      Sort coefs by value of x
      X Generate combinations based on number of terms from COEF
      (and thus from CONST), using itertools.product()
      X Select exclusive entries from COEF and CONST lists using
      itertools.compress()
      Sum sub-coefs together for n^x term
Return final expression in linear form
'' in table form
