Purpose: Associate sequences of 3 digits with their permutations
Comments: Why am I doing something to do with PnC AGAIN? I'm no good
at this topic.
itertools.permutations(iterable, r=None) is close, but not quite there.
I want to cluster the permutations together.
Currently the sequences are stored as tuples of string(digits), so I have to
join them and convert them before I print them.
I wrote a separate function listConvert to create a new list for storing
either string or integer values of my output.
